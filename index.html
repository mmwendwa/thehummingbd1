    <h1><b>The Humming Bird</b></h1>
    <p>The Hummingbird tells the story of Marco Carrera, an ophthalmologist. He marries the wrong-but-right-but-wrong woman – Marina, who is unfaithful. He loves the right-but-wrong-but-right woman – Luisa, and she is unavailable. He is his sister’s sentinel; but she kills herself. He falls out with his brother and is sadly estranged. His parents are emotionally disfigured by their own trials and yet he must deal with their problems (vindictive rages, emotional blocks, late-marital misery) and then bear witness to them enduring brutal forms of cancer. He betrays his best friend, the man who saved his life. He develops a gambling addiction. His daughter, whom he loves dearly, suffers an inexplicable accident. He is left with his miracle granddaughter, Miraijin, whom he must raise. He never discovers who her father is or why she has been given a Japanese name – meaning “man of the future” – but it is she who gives him reason to go on living.</p>
    <p>Veronesi delivers Carrera’s story by moving backwards and forwards in time:registartion page <a href="https://mmwendwa.github.io/Frank-ssites/"></a> the chapter titles tell us we’re in the 1970s, or in 2018, or 1988-1999 or, at the end, in 2030. Meanwhile, the form itself changes – sometimes we’re reading narrative, sometimes pure dialogue, sometimes letters, poetry, emails, inventories, postcards. The effect is to keep everything fresh and engaging. You remain alert. You sift. You piece the life together like a mosaic. Sure, there may be one or two tiles that you don’t love (a couple of chapters felt levered in, to me – as though Veronesi was trying to find a home for something he had written elsewhere), but these prove to be the exceptions and the overall effect is magnificent – moving, replete, beautiful.</p>
    <p>There is plenty for the plot junkie – Carrera is pummelled by events – but what makes the book special is that The Hummingbird is such an intelligent meditation on life, family, the human heart and the “dictatorship of pain” that comes with grief. I was reminded of how very much I used to enjoy the kinds of writers who have you underlining passages or making notes in the margin – not just about the book itself, but about your own thoughts on, say, friendship, or lust, or loss. I’m thinking of my early adventures as a reader with Milan Kundera or Umberto Eco, though Veronesi has a very different atmosphere: more tender, more emotionally exasperated, less sure and continually at home to Rudyard Kipling’s “six honest serving men … What and Why and When and How and Where and Who.”</p>
